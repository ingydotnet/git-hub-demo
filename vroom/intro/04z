                                               GitHub Web UI Sucks

     * Not really a bad Web UI/UX

     * Web is just not a good power tool
     * Fine for basic tasks
     * Simple things simple
     * Hard things impossible

     * Not scriptable
     * Try creating 100 new repos
     * Try adding all g0v members as collabs to 10 repos

     * Let's try it!
